You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `NBA` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only NBA players who were in the 2020 draft class."
2. Sorting: "Show all players sorted by Height in descending order."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How does standing reach relate to vertical leap height?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
